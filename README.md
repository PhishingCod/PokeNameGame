Project Description

This project is a web-based guessing game that challenges users to identify Pokémon from their silhouettes. It's built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a fun, nostalgic, and educational experience for new and seasoned Pokémon trainers.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Many people are unaware of the rich and diverse world of Pokémon. This knowledge gap is a significant problem, as it leaves them unprepared for surprise battles and trivial pursuits. This project aims to train them in the art of Pokémon recognition.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Our solution is a fun, interactive web game that forces users to learn Pokémon silhouettes. It's a high-stakes, high-reward training simulator that makes learning Pokémon as addictive as catching them.
