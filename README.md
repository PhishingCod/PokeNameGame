# PokeNameGame
Just a chill website which is a Pokemon Name Game

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
New Pokémon trainers are constantly challenged to identify Pokémon by their silhouettes, a crucial skill for any true master. However, without a dedicated training platform, they rely on luck and memory, often failing to recognize even the most iconic Pokémon. This project aims to solve this critical training gap.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution is a nostalgic, web-based game that challenges users to identify Pokémon from a vast library of silhouettes. The game provides a fun and engaging training ground, with features like customizable backgrounds and a dynamic scoring system to track progress. It is a simple yet effective tool for new and seasoned trainers to hone their recognition skills.
